# Web Scraping API Development using AI
Your challenge is to create an API to scrape product listings from an e-commerce page.
Hereâ€™s an example URL:
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=nike&_sacat=0&rt=nc&_pgn=1

Requirements:
Core Requirements (Mandatory):
Use Javascript.
Use AI to get the data from the page (Deepseek is a plus point).
Results must be returned in JSON format.
Make AI can extract at least the product name, product price, and product description.
You can visit each product's detail page and retrieve the product description provided by the seller inside the nested product detail page.
Scrape all products across pagination.
If any field (e.g., product price or description) does not have a value, return '-'


# How to use The File
The Index.HTML are using sk API which will doesnt work if you try to copy,
